### Short description

It enables us to use the radio joining/switching/exiting from 1.00 MHz to 1000.00 MHz (1.00-10.00 MHz its reserved for police, ambulance and fire) for officers and civilian. We can set in the `config.lua` what channels are to be restricted(default 1 - 10), and what should be opened to anyone who has the item `radio`

### Info

To work you must add item `radio` in your database
